# Eventapp

This project was an early iOS prototype for an event discovery application called Eventzap. 

My partner and I used a custom API that queried Facebook to plot nearby events on a map screen. The client application also had social profiles and an event organizer for keeping track of RSVPs.

We decided to shift our development efforts to other projects when Facebook announced their standalone Events mobile app in August 2016. Admittedly, we had most of their app's main features, but they could offer a better user experience with unrestricted access to their events/pages social graph.

## Notes

I haven't yet optimized this for Swift 3 or Xcode 8. After running Convert Syntax, it will likely need a few custom edits.
